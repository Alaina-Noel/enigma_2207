class Encryptor

  def initialize
    #I want to initialize it with a shift_generator object?
  end

  def apply_shift(message, shifter)
#how do I get these classes to recieve each others information without
#doing something like enigma.encryptor.apply_shift
  end

  #maybe I need to condense things more and say that enigma can contain the method
  #apply shift and have instance variables of shift_generator and those isntance
  #variables can have methods?
